		<h2>We hope you all are as excited as we are with release of this year&#39;s FIRST Robotics Competition game,  Destination: Deep Space.</h2>  
		<h4 class="date">Jan 8 2019:</h4>
		<div>
			With the successful launch of the new season now behind us we would like to share some important information and reminders as we charter forward.  Please read through everything below.
			<br><br>
	 		Game Manual:  One of the best ways to set you team up for success, during the season, is to carefully read through and understand the entire Destination: Deep Space game manual.
	 		<br><br>
	 		Team Updates:  Every Tuesday, during the season, FIRST will share out any updates and/or clarifications to the game and/or rules.  It is very important to not only fully read the game manual but also to stay on top of the weekly updates.  Updates will be posted of the game manual page found here.
	 		<br><br>
	 		FRC Q&A System: The official FRC Question & Answer System opens tomorrow, 1/9.  This is the only place to get official answers to your game question.  Anyone can view the questions and answers but only team accounts can post questions.  Team&#39;s Q&A login information can be found on their Dashboard under <q>Team Options</q> : <q>Payment and Product</q> : <q>Passwords/Voucher Codes</q> : <q>FIRST Official Q&A Password.</q>
	 		<br><br>
	 		FRC Blog:  Make sure you are reading the FRC blogs as they come out.  There is lots of important and helpful information shared through these posts. If you are not receiving the FRC blogs through your email, you can always find them online here.
	 		<br><br>
	 		FIRST Choice – Round 2:  Second round of FIRST Choice closes Thursday, 1/10.   Teams must make their preference selections by 12:00pm EST on 1/10.  Information on FIRST Choice and the website can be found here.
	 		<br><br>
	 		Kickoff Kit Replacement Parts:  Hopefully by now your team has had the opportunity to look through the exciting kit of parts they received at Kickoff.  We encourage your teams to inventory the Kickoff Kit to make sure you received everything you were supposed to.  Kickoff Kit inventory checklist can be found here.  If you team finds they are missing parts you can request replacements for items missing.  This is done through your team’s Dashboard under <q>Team Options</q> : <q>Payment and Product</q> : <q>Order Replacement Parts.</q>  Teams can only submit one replacement part request and it must be submitted by Friday, 1/11, 12:00pm EST.  Additional information can be found here.
	 		<br><br>
	 		FIRST Choice Open Ordering:  After round 2 of FIRST Choice has been fulfilled it will open again on 1/18.  At this point teams will be able to purchase on a first come first serve basis using any remaining credits they have.  More info here.
	 		<br><br>
	 		Additional Event Payments:  If your team is competing at more than one regional you will need to pay for all your additional events (regionals and/or championship) by 5:00pm EST on Thursday, 1/24.  Please make sure to reach out to FIRST Finance, at 1-800-871-8326 ext. 563 or ar@firstinspires.org, if your team is going to have any issues meeting this deadline.  Payments are completed through your team&#39;s Dashboard.
	 		<br><br>
	 		Additional Regional:  Is your team so excited about Destination: Deep Space, they are now looking for another regional to compete at?  Good news we have added the Del Mar Regional, in San Diego, on week one and there is still space available.  If your team would like to register for the Del Mar Regional please reach out to FRC Team Support at <a target="_top" href="mailto:firstroboticscompetition@firstinspires.org">firstroboticscompetition@firstinspires.org</a> with your request.
	 		<br><br>
	 		Regional/Championship Housing:  If your team is going to be traveling to one or more competitions we hope you are working on your travel plans.  As a reminder FIRST works with a travel company to negotiate hotel and travel deals for our teams at many of our regionals and the championship events.  To learn about the travel deals and benefits please check out the FIRST Event Housing and Travel Discounts, which can be found here.
	 		<br><br>
	 		Regional Volunteers:  With 12 regionals in California, over 6 weeks this season, we are looking for a lot of volunteers to help us put on the great events for your teams.  We could use everyone&#39;s support in getting the word out about volunteering at regionals.  Please share the FIRST Volunteer website at <a target="_blank" href="https://www.firstinspires.org/ways-to-help/volunteer">https://www.firstinspires.org/ways-to-help/volunteer</a> with anyone and everyone you think might be interested in volunteering and helping us out.
	 		<br><br>
	 		Championship Conference Opportunity:  Would you like to present at our FIRST Championship Conferences?  We&#39;re looking for presentations of technical and non-technical topics, including:
	 		<br><br>
			Technical Resources
			Mentor/Coach/Volunteer Resources
			Scholarship & Alumni
			Education
			Diversity & Inclusion
			Innovation & Entrepreneurship
			A session (50 minutes in length) covers one topic in depth. Workshops (110 minutes in length) cover topics and skills that are important the FIRST community - recent changes, new approaches, and timely content - and also provide substantive training and opportunities. Submit your idea on or before Friday, January 11, 2019. Please note that travel and accommodations will not be provided by FIRST.
			<br><br><br><br>
	 		As always, we are here to help and support in any way we can.  Please refer to the attached document if you are not sure who to reach out to in your area.
